# Digital-production-and-logistics-systems-Project-Module-2

The developed project tackles the Vehicle Routing Problem for real-case scenarios.
Considering a realistic logistics problem for which a company, interested in deploying
electric vehicles with the purpose of loading and unloading various goods in a metropolitan
area (in this case, Milan), questions how to optimize the usage of its fleet, the present
work analyzes real-time data answering in manners of times.
The proposed solution revolves around the exploitation of Google APIs in order to fetch
data that reflects the real world.
Information is used to tune a model with the goal of minimizing the time required to visit
all the different clients.
The result is first presented numerically through the solution proposed by CPLEX library
implemented in Python.
Human readable graphics help in this task, showing the chosen routes that the vehicles
will make.
